# web-scraping-demo

# requirements
**python3**, 
**git**

# 1. Check python version
I asume that python3 is installed in your system.
To check python version just open terminal and type the command below:
    
    python3 --version
# 2. Now clone ***web-scraping-demo*** project from github
    git clone  
# 3. Go to the project from the terminal where ***main.py*** file is
# 4. Now install necessary python dependencies by runnung the command below
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
# 5. Now just type the command below in your terminal to run the project
    python3 main.py
    
This will run the project and will scrap necessary information from the url which is 
defined in the project(the url is hardcoded for now).
Also a new **.csv** file will be created and the retrieved informatins will be
written into that file.
